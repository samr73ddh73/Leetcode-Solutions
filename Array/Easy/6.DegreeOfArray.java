/*Given a non-empty array of non-negative integers nums, the degree of this array is defined as the maximum frequency of any one of its elements.
Your task is to find the smallest possible length of a (contiguous) subarray of nums, 
that has the same degree as nums.

Example 1:
Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The input array has a degree of 2 because both elements 1 and 2 appear twice.
Of the subarrays that have the same degree:
[1, 2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2], [2, 2, 3], [2, 2]
The shortest length is 2. So return 2.
*/
/*Solution:Approach #1: Left and Right Index [Accepted]
An array that has degree d, must have some element x occur d times. If some subarray has the same degree, then some element x (that occured d times), still occurs d times. 
The shortest such subarray would be from the first occurrence of x until the last occurrence.*/


//--> Look at the way of writing the solution
class Solution {
    public int findShortestSubArray(int[] nums) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> left = new HashMap(),right = new HashMap(), count = new HashMap();

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int x = nums[i];
            if (left.get(x) == null) 
                left.put(x, i);
            right.put(x, i);
            count.put(x, count.getOrDefault(x, 0) + 1);
        }

        int ans = nums.length;
        int degree = Collections.max(count.values());
        for (int x: count.keySet()) {
            if (count.get(x) == degree) {
                ans = Math.min(ans, right.get(x) - left.get(x) + 1);
